# ISE3230_Group10
Final Project for ISE 3230

Fantasy Baseball Stats is a CSV file that has four variables:

'Player' : Player Name

'Positions' : Positions that the player plays (from Fantasy Pros ADP list)

'ADP' : Average Draft Position for player (from Fantasty Pros ADP list)

'ESPN Fantasy Points' : number of ESPN fantasy points that the player earned in 2025 season (https://fantasy.espn.com/baseball/leaders)

In this file, Shohei Ohtani is listed three times. Once in general, one as batter, and once as pitcher. Wasn't sure what to do with this but be aware that he is listed three times in the dataset. Players with NA for their Fantasty Points did not have any statistics/didn't play.
